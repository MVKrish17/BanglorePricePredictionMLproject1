This data science project series focuses on guiding the audience through the comprehensive process of constructing a real estate price prediction website. The project involving the creation of a predictive model using Scikit-learn library which contains linear regression, build using Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle.com. The subsequent steps involve establishing a Python Flask server to handle HTTP requests and serve model predictions. The final component of the project involves designing a user-friendly website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enabling users to input property specifications. The website interacts with the Flask server to retrieve and display predicted property prices. Throughout the model development phase, a wide array of data science concepts are explored, encompassing data preprocessing, outlier detection, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and evaluating the model ability using K-fold cross-validation. This project encompasses a diverse set of technologies and tools.


**STEPS TO CREATE THE PROJECT:**
        1. Data Collection and Cleaning:
             Download the Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle.
             Clean the dataset by handling missing values and outliers.
             Implement data preprocessing techniques, including feature scaling and one hot encoding.
             Detect and handle outliers to improve model robustness.
             Engage in feature engineering to enhance model accuracy.
             Apply dimensionality reduction methods to handle high-dimensional data.
             To evaluate the model ability using cross-validation.
        2. Model Development:
             Utilize Scikit-learn library to create a linear regression model.
             Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
             Train the model using the training data.
             Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
        3. Python Flask Server:
             Develop a Flask server that loads the trained model.
             Create endpoints to handle HTTP requests and return predictions.
        4. Website Design:
             Design a user-friendly website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
             Implement input fields for property features (square ft area, bedrooms, etc.).
             Utilize JavaScript to fetch predictions from the Flask server and display them on the website
